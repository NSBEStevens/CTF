A Farmer is travelling with his pet Wolf, his Chicken, and a bag of Chicken Seed.

He comes across a river too big to cross on foot but had a rowboat large enough to fit him and one of his 3 things at a time.

In order to cross the river, he must be careful: if he leaves his Chicken alone with his Chicken seed, it will eat the whole bag.

Similarly, if he leaves the Chicken alone with the Wolf, the Wolf will eat the Chicken.

Remember, he can only bring 1 thing across the river at a time.

How many times must he cross the river in order to bring all 3 of his things across the river safely?
